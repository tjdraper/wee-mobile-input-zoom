# Mobile Input Zoom for Wee 2.x

Wee Module for disabling iOS page zoom when clicking inputs.

## Quick Start

This module is made for [Wee](http://www.weepower.com) and assumes you are already up and running with Wee.

To use this module, create a directory called `mobile-input-zoom` in Wee's `"modules"` directory and drop the contents of this repository in that directory. Thatâ€™s it. As long as you leave this module set to autoload, the javascript will detect a tap on an input and prevent iOS from zooming into it.
